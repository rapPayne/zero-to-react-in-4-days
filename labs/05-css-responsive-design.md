# Responsive design lab

In this lab, you will make the navigation bar responsive. When the screen width is phone-sized, the menu options should stack vertically. When the screen width is wider, the menu options should be displayed side-by-side.

### Instructions:

1. Edit your CSS file. Use media queries to apply different styles based on the screen width.
  - For screens wider than 600px, display the menu options side-by-side.
  - For screens 600px or narrower, stack the menu options vertically.
1. Test your changes by resizing the browser window to ensure the navigation bar adjusts correctly.


Note to the instructor: This lab can be skipped or deferred until after any later lab if you're behind schedule. There are no dependencies on this lab for the rest of the course.
