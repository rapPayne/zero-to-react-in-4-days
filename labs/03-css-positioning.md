# Positioning Lab

## Static positioning
1. Look at your landing page in the browser. Make the browser small so that the vertical scrollbar appears. Scroll to the bottom. Notice that the navbar at the top scrolls out of view.
1. Apply a CSS position property to the navbar's container such that no matter where you scroll, it remains locked to the top of the screen.
1. When you're successful, you'll notice that part of the first menuItem may be hidden behind the navbar. Add a top padding to the `<body>` of the page so it stops just below the navbar.
1. Do it again for the navbar at the top of the cart page. If you do it right, you will be sharing CSS code between those two pages so you can write the code once.
