# Labs

In this folder you'll find the lab exercises for this course. They are 
- sequential; you must finish each lab before you move on to the next
- cumulative; each lab begins where the prior left off
- high-level; you'll be told what to do but not how to do it. This is how requirements in the real-world are written. You're expected to figure out how to do each step based on the chapters covered. If you don't know what to do, review the course material, google the topic, and ask someone for help, usually in that order.
